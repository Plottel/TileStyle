# Tile Style

An SDK (stub) for creating tile-based levels. Built in my 2nd semester of university for a semester project.

### Feature List
* Multiple layers
* Construct multi-layered tiles from existing single-layered tiles and add them to your palette
* Dynamic bitmaps (e.g. a square road tile will become a straight strip when another road tile is placed next to it)  
* Saving / Loading (FileIO)
